This is a basic recipe website that is created as a part of my learning on The Odin Project. By the end of building website, I should be comfortable with using HTML to set up a website, which includes things like paragraphs, lists (unordered/ordered list), different sections, links to other pages, photos/images/animations. Hopefully this'll turn out well woo!
